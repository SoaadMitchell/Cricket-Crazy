        <h1><i>All about SA cricket</i></h1>
        <br>
        <p>South Africans love their cricket, and the reaction to the Proteas not playing as they used to confirms it. Although the Proteas aren't playing up to their full potential, we should support them in their victories and their loses. Remember...<i>Inspire the #ProteaFire, your support matters.</i> We should remember about the good old days. How the Proteas grew, how cricket became one of South Africa's popular sport and of course our Cricket Legends.</p>
          <br>
        <p>South Africaa has many great memories when it comes to cricket. In 1992 group match, South Africa vs. Pakistan, when Jonty Rhodes 'Superman' run-out Pakistan's batsman Inzamam-ul-Haqq. In the 31st over, Inzamam attempted a single for a leg bye. Imran Khan, then captain of Pakistan shouted, "No" and while trying to get back to his crease, Inzamam saw Jonty Rhodes sprinting towards the stups from deep backward point. And then, Jonty- grabbing the ball in his right han- threw himself at the stumps with his feet off the ground and run-out Inzamam. His dismissal denyted Pakistan's wonderful momentum, causing them  to lose the match</p>
        <br>
        <p>The moment the Proteas' women got their first victory against New Zealand. They beat the New Zealands' White Ferns by five wickets to qualify for the semi-finals of the ICC Women's World T20. New Zealand was restricted to a modest total of 114/8 after winning the toss and choosing to bat first.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Over the years, South AFrica's cricket team players have broken many records and etched their names in the annals of cricket folklore. The most famous of them al is the world record run chase against Australia at Wanderers. Jacques Kallis holds the national record for most Test Matches, runs andcenturies. While Hashim Amla holds the record for highest Test score, Shaun Pollock is their all-time leading Test wicket-taker. While Kallis is once again the leading run-getter for South Africa's cricket team in ODIs and has the most half-centuries, Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers joinytly hold the record for the most centuries. Shaun Pollock is the leading wicket-taker in ODIs while Imran Tahir holds the record for best ODI bowling figures</p>
